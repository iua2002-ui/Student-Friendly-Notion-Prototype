# Student-Friendly Notion Prototype

Welcome to the Student-Friendly Notion Prototype, a fresh take on productivity tools designed specifically for students. This app streamlines the page, calendar, and comments sections, making it easier for students to organize their work, collaborate with peers, and stay on top of their schedules. The prototype features a fully fleshed-out homepage GUI, a login page, and real-time updates for comments and posts.


## Features

1. Streamlined Interface

Integrated Calendar: Easily manage deadlines, events, and tasks with a built-in calendar that syncs with your pages.

Comments Section: Collaborate seamlessly with real-time updates on comments and posts, ensuring everyone stays in the loop.

2. Collaboration Across Users
Real-Time Collaboration: Work together with classmates or group members in real time. See updates to pages, comments, and calendar events as they happen.

User Roles: Assign different roles (e.g., editor, viewer) to control access and editing permissions.

3. Prototype Features
Homepage GUI: A fully designed homepage that provides quick access to your pages, calendar, and recent activity.

Login Page: Secure login and user authentication to ensure your data is protected.

Real-Time Updates: Experience instant updates in the comments and posts sections, making collaboration smooth and efficient.
